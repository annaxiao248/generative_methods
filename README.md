## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?

My first generator genterates flowers. 

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The user can change the hue of the flower and adjust the thickness of the petals, as well as the number of petals. 

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

sliders: 
1. size: size of the petals
2. aspectRatio: length/width of petals
3. angle: angle of flower
4. hue: hue of petals
5. bightness: petal brightness
6. petals: number of petals

These variables can be adjusted to genrate an entirely 
different looking flower.


## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

1. pumpkin: a round flower that looks like the top of a pumpkin
2. sunshine: yellow flower that looks like a beam of sunshine
3. scarlet: small red circles/dots
4. peach: a peach flower with no space in center
5. daisy: a yellow flower with space in center

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?

It can't generate new stems and leaves (number of leaves per flower can't be changed). 

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

I wanted to change the number of petals that can be generated but the position of the petals 
was not evenly spaced.   

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?

My second generator generates ducks.

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?

The generator can generate party hats for the ducks. 

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this

sliders:
1. duckSize: size of the duck
2. partyHat:height of the part hat
3. angle: angle of the duck 
4. hue: due of the duck
5. brightness: brightness of the duck and party hat
6: hatHue: hue of the party hat

These variables can be adjusted to genrate different looking ducks 
with differnt sizes, color and party hats.


## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?

1. bigBlue: generates a big blue duck without a party hat
2. mamaDuck: generates a big, pale yellow duck
3. babyDuck: generates a small, pale yellow duck
4. partyDuck: generates a duck with a party hat
5. rubberDuck: genrates a medium sized duck in the classic rubber duck yellow


## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?

It can't change the eye and bill colors. It also can not generate a tail for the duck. 

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?

I wanted to mask the party hat it give it more interesting patterns and designs.
However, the masking was not working so I just gave the ducks soild color hats. 

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?

The flower generator has a more interesting possibility space. Changing the 
variables enough can create some very interesting looking flowers. I was able to
make one that looks like a beam of sunshine.

## List any resources (code, images, etc) you've used, and where you got them from

flower loop from https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-simple-shapes.html

## List any help you got from classmates or websites, so that you can remember it for later
